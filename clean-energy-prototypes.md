## Solar Power:
   ## Solar Panels: 
    -- Traditional solar panels convert sunlight into electricity. There are ongoing to improve difficiency and reduce costs.
   ## Thin-Film Solar Cells:
    -- These are lightweight and flexible solar panels that can be integrate into various surfaces.

## Wind Power:
   ## Vertical Axix Wind Turbines(VAWT):
    -- An alternative to traditional horizontal axis turbines, VAWTs are designed to capture wind from any direction.
   ## Offshore Wild Farms: 
    -- Placing wind turbines in bodies of water, where winds are often stronger and more consistent.

## Hydroelectric Power:
   ## Tidal Energy:
    -- Harnessing the energy from ocean tides to generate electricity.
   ## Wave Energy Converters:
    -- Devices that capture the energy from ocean waves and convert it into electricity.

## Geothermal Energy:
   ## Geothermal Power Plants:
     -- Utilizing the Earth's internal heat to produce steam and generate electricity.
   ## Geothermal Heat Pumps:
     -- Used for heating and cooling building by taking advantage of the temperature beneath the Earth's surface.

## Bioenergy:
   ## Biofuel Production:
     -- Converting organic materials such as crops or waste into biofules for transporatation.
   ## Biogas Digesters:
     --  Turning organic waste into methane for use in heating or electricity generation.
